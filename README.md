# Module 19 Neural Network Modeling
### by Terra Lasho 
## Overview of the Analysis: For this project, I have created a deep learning model for AlphabetSoup, using knowledge of machine learning and neural networks.  I used a dataset to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by AlphabetSoup.

## Deliverable 1: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
### Part 1: Open the file in pandas dataframe:

### Part 2: Drop the EIN and Name Columns in the dataset:

### Part 3: Determine the unique datapoints for each column:

### Part 4: Density Plot (to create a cut-off point to bin “rare” categorical variables in a new column “other”):

### Part 5: Merge the one-hot encoding dataframe with the original and drop the originals:

### Part 6: Split the preprocessed data into features and target arrays, and then into training and testing datasets, then standardize numerical variables using StandardScaler:

## Deliverable 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
### Part1: 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Deliverable 3: Optimize the Model
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Results:
### Data Preprocessing:
-	What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
-	What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
-	What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:
-	How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
-	Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
-	What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
-	
## Summary:
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
